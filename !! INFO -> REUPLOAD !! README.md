# Aimware-v5-luas

I needed to reupload full folder.. alot of files got updated (i think 106 files or something like that are newer versions than before),
but i accidently deleted the list so i can´t write down all the updated ones in a list, sry for that..

The new "v5.+" folder contains the most actual and updated scripts that u can find on froum or on some other smaller places 
(which are more or less hidden ones) and that are used the most by (nearly) everyone right now..


have fun :D


# Additional SideNote:

When i reuploaded it i was too lazy to sortout some luas that are outdated or broken so i just put the whole folder.
And i still didnt remove the files from my folder because some of them contain functions u need/could use in your own scripts
or other ones are well documantated and everything got explaint by comments so that u can learn how things working..
